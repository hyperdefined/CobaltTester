// : DISPLAY SECTION :: This defines whatever happens on a member's individual site: most notably, inserting a little display. :

// Before you can use this, please replace all instances of cobaltWebring with your webring name in lower case.

// ... Let's begin.

// For displaying messages of all kinds, as well as the working webring display, we want to keep our little HTML element in mind.
// Remember to insert your webring's name here, just like everywhere, if you host this webring.
var displayElement = document.getElementById("cobaltWebring"); 
displayElement.style.textAlign = "center";

// First of all, we want to check whether we are even a member of this particular webring, and if so, at which position.
var currentLocation = displayElement.getAttribute("name") || window.location.hostname;
var siteIndex = cobaltWebring_members.indexOf(currentLocation);

// If our current location is NOT in the webring, display an error message. The rest of the code only runs if the site has been found in the webring.
if (siteIndex == -1) {
    displayElement.innerHTML =
    "<p>Sorry! Looks like this domain is not in the webring, can't display it.</p>";
} else {
    // This is a readable (but technologically not very sound) way to loop around when you are either the first or last member of the webring.
    var beforeID;
    var afterID;
    if (siteIndex == 0) { beforeID = cobaltWebring_members.length - 1; }
    else { beforeID = siteIndex - 1; }
    if (siteIndex == cobaltWebring_members.length - 1) { afterID = 0; }

    // This chooses a random website from a copy of the member list.
    var randomID;
    randomID = Math.floor(Math.random() * cobaltWebring_members.length);

    // Now it is time to get to the meaty stuff. This will replace our little display container with the actual display content: a general badge, next/previous buttons, and a webring info and random link.
    // Remove, swap around or change these components as you see fit.
