description: "an api to access the instance list"
---
This is a simple API to access the list of instances. Please don't scrape this site, you can parse the API and make our lives both easier.

All the instance data is store here: <code>https://instances.hyper.lol/instances.json</code>. This JSON file is created when the script runs. The script runs every 30 minutes and completes within 10 minutes.

<strong>Please set a proper user agent when making requests!</strong> I block common user agents (like `curl`, `python-requests`, `Go-http-client` etc) due to many bots hitting this server. I want to know who uses this API!

<div class="banner not-safe">
    <h3>PLEASE READ!</h3>
    <p>cobalt recently has updated to version 10! Please note: any instance that is running on version 10 <strong>WILL HAVE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS.</strong></p>
    <p>You should account for these differences, or filter whatever API version you want instead. You can see the API docs below.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/blob/7/docs/api.md">Version 7 API docs</a></p>

### Example
When calling the API, it will return a JSON array that contains all instances. Here is a snippet of what information an instance has:

### What are each keys?
This section explains what each key in the JSON mean for an instance.

Some of these keys are pulled directly from the API of an instance. You can see an example [here](https://api.cobalt.tools/api/serverInfo).
* `version`: The version the instance is running.
* `commit`: The commit the instance is running.
* `branch`: This the branch the instance is running.
* `name`: The "name" of the instance.
* `api`: The API URL of the instance.
* `cors`: If the instance has CORS enabled/disabled.
* `startTime`: The time the instance started up.
* `score`: The test score of the instance. This is a percentage. The closer to 100%, the more services that work with the instance.
* `api_online`: Whether or not the API is online.
* `protocol`: What protocol the instance uses (http/https).
* `frontEnd`: The frontend URL of the instance.
* `trust`: If the instance is considered "trusted" or not. These will be `safe/unknown/not_safe`.

### Services
In the services JSON, each service is listed. If it's able to download media for it, it's set to `true`. If it failed, it's set to `false`.
